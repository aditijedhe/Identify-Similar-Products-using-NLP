# Identify-Similar-Products-using-NLP
In this project, I have used cosine similarity to identify similar products from Amazon and Flipkart sample datasets which are extracted from free open data sources. <br>
The original size of the datset is 20000 rows in each dataframe, I have taken a sample 1000 entires since computation for such a large dataframe can be expensive.<br>


I have selected similar products based on the cosine similarity score from the Flipkart dataset with the Amazon dataset. Once similar products are matched, they are displayed in a form of a dataframe with there retail price from FK and AMZ side by side. <br>
